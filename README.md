# Dotfiles
A total mess right now, and mainly for my own convenience, but if you want to use my setup just clone the repo to your home directory and run the install script.

### Installation
```shell
❯ git clone https://github.com/pkrll/Dotfiles
❯ mv Dotfiles .dotfiles
```

Then run ``.makesym.sh`` in the ``setup`` folder. And that's it.

### Update
To update, just run the command:
```shell
❯ makesym
--------------------------------
Running makesym.sh...
